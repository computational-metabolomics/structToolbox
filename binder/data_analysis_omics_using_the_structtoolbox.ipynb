    "# Introduction\n",
    "The 'structToolbox' includes an extensive set of data (pre-)processing and analysis tools for metabolomics and other omics, with a strong emphasis on statistics and machine learning. The methods and tools have been implemented using class-based templates available via the `struct` (Statistics in R Using Class-based Templates) package. The aim of this vignette is to introduce the reader to basic and more advanced structToolbox-based operations and implementations, such as the use of `struct` objects, getting/setting methods/parameters, and building workflows for the analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based Metabolomics and proteomics datasets. The workflows demonstrated here include a wide range of methods and tools including pre-processing such as filtering, normalisation and scaling, followed by univariate and/or multivariate statistics, and machine learning approaches. \n",

    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and PLS (Partial Least Squares) are commonly applied methods for exploring and analysing multivariate datasets. Here we use these two statistical methods to demonstrate the different types of `struct` (STatistics in R Using Class Templates) objects that are available as part of the `structToolbox` and how these objects (i.e. class templates) can be used to conduct unsupervised and supervised multivariate statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "For demonstration purposes we will use the \"Iris\" dataset. This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) dataset contains measurements of sepal length and width and petal length and width, in centimeters, for 50 flowers from each of 3 class of Iris. The class are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. See here (https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/iris.html) for more information.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This vignette provides an overview of a `structToolbox` workflow implemented to process (e.g. filter features, signal drift and batch correction, normalise and missing value imputation) mass spectrometry data. The workflow exists of methods that are part of the Peak Matrix Processing (`r Biocpkg('pmp')`) package, including a range of additional filters that are described in Kirwan et al., [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-013-6856-7), [2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2014.12).\n",

This dataset represents a systematic evaluation of the reproducibility of a multi-batch direct-infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS)-based metabolomics study of cardiac tissue extracts. It comprises twenty biological samples (cow vs. sheep) that were analysed repeatedly, in 8 batches across 7 days, together with a concurrent set of quality control (QC) samples. Data are presented from each step of the data processing workflow and are available through MetaboLights (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS79). \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this vignette is to illustrate how to apply SVM analysis for Classifying Metabolomics data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector Machines (SVM) are a commonly used method in Machine Learning. For classification tasks they are used to generate a boundary between groups of samples in the training set. As well as generating linear boundaries, SVM can be extended to exploit the use of kernels and generate complex non-linear boundaries between groups if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `structToolbox` package, SVM functionality provided by the `r CRANpkg(\"e1071\")` package has been incorporated into a `model` object. A chart object (`svm_plot_2d`) is also available to plot SVM boundaries for data with two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The 1H-NMR dataset used and described in [Mendez et al., (2020)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-019-1588-0, https://github.com/CIMCB/MetabWorkflowTutorial) and in this vignette contains processed spectra of urine samples obtained from gastric cancer and healthy patients [Chan et al., (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2015414). The raw experimental data is available through Metabolomics Workbench ([PR000699](http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8B10B)) and the processed version is available from [here](https://github.com/CIMCB/MetabWorkflowTutorial/raw/master/GastricCancer_NMR.xlsx) as an Excel data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we will use a pre-processed version of the 1H-NMR \"Gastric cancer\" dataset using the `structToolbox` package. Details in regards to pre-processing are reported in the \"NMR_clinical_metabolomics\" vignette of the `r Biocpkg(\"structToolbox\") package."
