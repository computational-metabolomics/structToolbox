\usage{
rsd_filter(rsd_threshold = 20, qc_label = "QC", factor_name, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{rsd_threshold}{(numeric) The RSD threshold below which features are removed. The default is \code{20}.}

\item{qc_label}{(character) The label used to identify QC samples. The default is \code{"QC"}.}

\item{factor_name}{(character) The name of a sample-meta column to use.}

\item{...}{Additional slots and values passed to \code{struct_class}.}
}
\value{
A  \code{rsd_filter} object.
}
\description{
An RSD filter calculates the relative standard deviation (the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation) for all features. Any feature with an RSD lower than a predefined threshold is excluded.
