\arguments{
\item{components}{(numeric) The principal components used to generate the plot. The default is \code{c(1, 2)}.}

\item{points_to_label}{(character) points_to_label. Allowed values are limited to the following: \itemize{\item{\code{"none"}: No samples are labelled on the plot.}\item{\code{"all"}: All samples are labelled on the plot.}\item{\code{"outliers"}: Potential outliers are labelled on the plot.}} The default is \code{"none"}.}

\item{factor_name}{(character) The name of a sample-meta column to use.}

\item{scale_factor}{(numeric) The scaling factor applied to the loadings. The default is \code{0.95}.}

\item{style}{(character) Plot style. Allowed values are limited to the following: \itemize{\item{\code{"points"}: Loadings and scores are plotted as a scatter plot.}\item{\code{"arrows"}: The loadings are plotted as arrow vectors.}} The default is \code{"points"}.}

\item{label_features}{(logical) Add feature labels. Allowed values are limited to the following: \itemize{\item{\code{"TRUE"}: Features are labelled.}\item{\code{"FALSE"}: Features are not labelled.}} The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Additional slots and values passed to \code{struct_class}.}

\value{
A  \code{pca_biplot} object.
