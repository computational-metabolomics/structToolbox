\title{Tukey's Honest Significant Difference}
\usage{
HSD(alpha = 0.05, mtc = "fdr", formula, unbalanced = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{(numeric) The p-value cutoff for determining significance. The default is \code{0.05}.\cr}

\item{mtc}{(character) Multiple test correction method. Allowed values are limited to the following: \itemize{ \item{\code{"bonferroni"}: Bonferroni correction in which the p-values are multiplied by the number of comparisons.}\item{\code{"fdr"}: Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction.}\item{\code{"none"}: No correction.}} The default is \code{"fdr"}.}

\item{formula}{(formula) A symbolic description of the model to be fitted.}

\item{unbalanced}{(logical) Unbalanced model. Allowed values are limited to the following: \itemize{ \item{\code{"TRUE"}: A correction is applied for unbalanced designs.}\item{\code{"FALSE"}: No correction is applied for unbalanced designs.}} The default is \code{FALSE}.\cr}

\item{...}{Additional slots and values passed to \code{struct_class}.}
}
\value{
A  \code{HSD} object with the following \code{output} slots:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{difference} \tab          (data.frame)  \cr
\code{UCL} \tab          (data.frame)  \cr
\code{LCL} \tab          (data.frame)  \cr
\code{p_value} \tab          (data.frame) The probability of observing the calculated statistic if the null hypothesis is true. \cr
\code{significant} \tab          (data.frame) True/False indicating whether the p-value computed for each variable is less than the threshold. \cr
}
}
\description{
Tukey's HSD post hoc test is a modified t-test applied for all features to all pairs of levels in a factor. It is used to determine which groups are different (if any). A multiple test corrected p-value is computed to indicate which groups are significantly different to the others for each feature.
