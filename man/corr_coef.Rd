\usage{
corr_coef(alpha = 0.05, mtc = "fdr", factor_names, method = "spearman", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{(numeric) The p-value cutoff for determining significance. The default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{mtc}{(character) Multiple test correction method. Allowed values are limited to the following: \itemize{\item{\code{"bonferroni"}: Bonferroni correction in which the p-values are multiplied by the number of comparisons.}\item{\code{"fdr"}: Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction.}\item{\code{"none"}: No correction.}} The default is \code{"fdr"}.}

\item{factor_names}{(character) The name of sample meta column(s) to use.}

\item{method}{(character) Type of correlation. Allowed values are limited to the following: \itemize{\item{\code{"kendall"}: Kendall's tau is computed.}\item{\code{"pearson"}: Pearson product moment correlation is computed.}\item{\code{"spearman"}: Spearman's rho statistic is computed.}} The default is \code{"spearman"}.}

\item{...}{Additional slots and values passed to \code{struct_class}.}
}
\value{
A  \code{corr_coef} object.
}
\description{
The correlation between features and a set of continuous factor are calculated. Multiple-test corrected p-values are used to indicate whether the computed coefficients may have occurred by chance.
}
\details{
This object makes use of functionality from the following packages:\itemize{\item{\code{stats}}}
}
\examples{
D = MTBLS79_DatasetExperiment(filtered=TRUE)

# subset for this example
D = D[,1:10]

# convert to numeric for this example
D$sample_meta$sample_order=as.numeric(D$sample_meta$sample_order)
D$sample_meta$sample_rep=as.numeric(D$sample_meta$sample_rep)

M = corr_coef(factor_names=c('sample_order','sample_rep'))
