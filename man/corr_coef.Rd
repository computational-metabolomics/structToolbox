\usage{
corr_coef(alpha = 0.05, mtc = "fdr", factor_names, method = "spearman", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{(numeric) The p-value cutoff for determining significance. The default is \code{0.05}.\cr}

\item{mtc}{(character) Multiple test correction method. Allowed values are limited to the following: \itemize{ \item{\code{"bonferroni"}: Bonferroni correction in which the p-values are multiplied by the number of comparisons.}\item{\code{"fdr"}: Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction.}\item{\code{"none"}: No correction.}} The default is \code{"fdr"}.}

\item{factor_names}{(character) The name of sample meta column(s) to use.}

\item{method}{(character) Type of correlation. Allowed values are limited to the following: \itemize{ \item{\code{"kendall"}: Kendall's tau is computed.}\item{\code{"pearson"}: Pearson product moment correlation is computed.}\item{\code{"spearman"}: Spearman's rho statistic is computed.}} The default is \code{"spearman"}.}

\item{...}{Additional slots and values passed to \code{struct_class}.}
}
\value{
A  \code{corr_coef} object with the following \code{output} slots:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{coeff} \tab          (data.frame) The value of the calculate statistics which is converted to a p-value when compared to a t-distribution. \cr
\code{p_value} \tab          (data.frame) The probability of observing the calculated statistic if the null hypothesis is true. \cr
\code{significant} \tab          (data.frame) True/False indicating whether the p-value computed for each variable is less than the threshold. \cr
}
}
\description{
The correlation between features and a set of continuous factor are calculated. Multiple-test corrected p-values are used to indicate whether the computed coefficients may have occurred by chance.
}
\details{
This object makes use of functionality from the following packages:\itemize{  \item{\code{stats}}}

\section{Inheritance}{

A \code{corr_coef} object inherits the following \code{struct} classes: \cr\cr
\verb{[corr_coef]} >> \verb{[model]} >> \verb{[struct_class]}
